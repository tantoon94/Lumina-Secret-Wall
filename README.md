# Lumina-Secret-Wall
This project is designed for the [CASA0014 Connected Environments](https://github.com/ucl-casa-ce/casa0014) module to build an IoT device to control The [Chrono Lumina](https://github.com/ucl-casa-ce/casa0014/tree/main/chronoLumina) LED lights at CASA, UCL, through an MQTT broker. This Wall is an IoT device that can control the Chrono Lumina via six LDR sensors placed inside six projected hexagons. The nodes on each hexagon correspond to the placement of six LED numbers on Chrono Lumina. By Shedding light on any hexagon's LDR sensor (with a kind of flashlight), six corresponding LEDs will light up five showing the intensity of the flashlight using a gradient of cold to warm colours and one only white indicating a piece of code to decipher. The wall's final code could be deciphered by identifying the coloured LED numbers and putting them together in order.
